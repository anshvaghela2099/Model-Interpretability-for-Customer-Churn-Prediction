# Model Interpretability for Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview

This notebook provides a comprehensive analysis of customer churn in the banking industry, focusing on predicting whether a customer will exit based on various factors and patterns. It leverages model interpretability techniques to offer actionable insights into the key drivers of customer churn.

## Dataset

The **Bank Customer Churn** dataset includes the following features:

1. `CustomerID`
2. `Credit Score`
3. `Country`
4. `Gender`
5. `Age`
6. `Tenure`
7. `Balance`
8. `Product Number`
9. `Credit Card`
10. `Active Member`
11. `Estimated Salary`
12. `Churn` (Target variable)

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Prepares the dataset for analysis and modeling.
- **Model Training**: Performs classification to predict churn using machine learning models.
- **Model Interpretability**: Utilizes tools like `SHAP`, `ELI5`, and feature importance techniques to explain model predictions.
- **Visualization**: Provides intuitive visualizations for better understanding of the data and model results.

## Requirements

This notebook requires the following Python libraries:

- `shap`
- `category_encoders`
- `eli5`
- `scikit-learn`
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
